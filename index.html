    <h2> The Ohio State University Consent to Participate in Research</h2>
    <p><b>Study Title: </b>Eye Movements and Political Decisions</br> </p>
    <p><b>Researcher:</b> Dr. Jason C. Coronel, Dr. Ian Krajbich, & Elizabeth Riggs </br></p>
    <p><b>This is a consent form for research participation.</b> It contains important information about
        this study and what to expect if you decide to participate. </br> </p>
    <p><b>Your participation is voluntary.</b></br></p>
    <p><b>Purpose: </b> The purpose of this study is to examine how people make voting decisions.</br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Procedures/Tasks: </b>
        For this study, you will be asked to make decisions on a variety of statewide ballot initiatives presented on a
        computer screen. While you view these ballots, your eye movements will be recorded by your web camera. In
        addition, you will be asked to fill out a brief demographics questionnaire and a questionnaire about political
        knowledge. </p>
    <p><b>Duration: </b></br>
        The study will take 60 minutes to complete. You may leave the study at any time. If you decide to stop
        participating in the study, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are
        otherwise entitled. Your decision will not affect your future relationship with The Ohio State
        University.  </br></p>
    <p><b>Risks and Benefits: </b></br>
        This study does not involve any more than minimal risk to the participant. In other words, there are no harms or
        discomforts beyond what is ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or
        psychological tests. </p>
    <p>You may benefit by gaining some knowledge about psychological research, both from the experience of participating
        and from the debriefing period following each session where the hypothesis of the study will be explained.</p>
    <p><b> Confidentiality: </b></br>
        Once the data collection for this study is completed, the researchers will destroy they link between your name
        and the data you contributed to the study. Following these procedures, there would then be no way to connect
        your answers back to you personally. </p>

    <p>The only record of your name that will be kept is the fact that you participated in this study, but this will no
        longer be connected to the answers you gave. </p>

    <p> Efforts will be made to keep your study-related information confidential. However, there may be circumstances
        where this information must be released. For example, personal information regarding your participation in this
        study may be disclosed if required by state law. Also, your records may be reviewed by the following
        groups: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Office for Human Research Protections or other federal, state, or international regulatory agencies
        </li>

    </ul>
